## About me

My journey with programming began when I started making games as a hobby couple of years ago.<br>
Then at my current job, I needed a system that will be able to track my work as a repair technician.
So I made a standalone program with .Net WinForms and MS Access as a database. 1.5 years later we are still using it.<br>
Then I wondered if there was a way to make it a web app. That's when I got introduced to Frontend. And since that day I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a badass Frontend Developer!
